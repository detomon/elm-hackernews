# Elm Hacker News Client

A [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) client using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org]).

## Build

This is only needed if something is changed. Needs `elm` and `uglifyjs` to build the script.

```sh
brew install elm
npm install -g uglify-js
```

Build `elm.min.js` with `make`:

```sh
make
```
